The files that were in this directory have been moved to a Google Drive here:

This is the Readme file for the directory that is now on Google Drive.

This directory has older versions of Fiji/ImageJ that work with the photo monitoring plugin. Each ZIP file includes Fiji/ImageJ and the photo monitoring plugin files. To use you can follow the installation instructions on the Fiji website: http://fiji.sc/Downloads. All of Fiji/ImageJ related files are from the “Fiji Life-Line version, 2014 November 25” versions available from the website linked above. 

These are the bundled software packages and the platforms that are supported:
Linux 32-bit: fiji-linux32-20141125_PM.zip 
Linux 64-bit: fiji-linux64-20141125_PM.zip  
Windows 32-bit: fiji-win32-20141125_PM.zip
Windows 64-bit: fiji-win64-20141125_PM.zip
All platforms (no JRE): fiji-nojre-20141125_PM.zip

NOTE: Support for OS X is coming but for now it is best to download the “Fiji Life-Line version, 2014 November 25” file from the website linked above and then follow the directions in the plugin installation guide. Once I am able to unpackage the OS X .dmg file I'll post that package here.
